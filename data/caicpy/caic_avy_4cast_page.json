On May 18, observers reported avalanches running in Castle Creek during a period of rainfall. There also was a very large avalanche reported from Mount Justice near Marble. The snowpack near and above treeline, especially on west to north through east-facing slopes, has not fully transitioned to a \"ripe\" spring snowpack consisting entirely of rounded snow grains. Rain can quickly saturate this snow and lead to large avalanches. The snowpack structure gradually becomes more homogenous at lower elevations and southerly slopes. Lower elevations have seen rain during previous events, and the snowpack has gone through numerous melt-freeze cycles. These slopes should be able to handle quite a bit of rainwater.\u003c/p\u003e\u003cp\u003eCloudy skies and warm temperatures overnight will keep the snowpack from refreezing.
